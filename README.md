# 100-Days-of-Code---Upes.
For 100 days, I'll be adding two codes daily. As such I'll learn and save my codes as well.
This will help me and all of you to access basic codes easily gradually advancing to complex and better algorithms and programs.
This includes 200 codes in C language. Although the codes are in C language but the logic is ame everywhere,this will increase the understanding of C language.
And we will together starting from the basics will dive deep into C language.

Every 10 questions are divided into branches like question 1-10 are in a branch and question 11-20 in another branch. 
As the branches increase the diificulty of the programs will increase as well and the codes will slowly get complexas we move closer to our goal of 200 codes.
