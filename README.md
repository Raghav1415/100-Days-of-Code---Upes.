# 100 Days of Code - UPES

Welcome to my personal repository for the **100 Days of Code** challenge, which I am undertaking as a student at UPES. This repository tracks my journey of solving 100+ programming problems using the C language.

## 🚀 About This Challenge

The goal of this project is to build a strong and consistent coding habit by solving problems every day. The problems are primarily focused on Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and are all implemented in **C**.

* **Language:** C
* **Goal:** 100 days of consistent problem-solving.
* **Difficulty:** The problems generally increase in difficulty as the days and question numbers progress.

## 📂 Repository Structure & How to Find Code

This repository uses a unique branching system to organize the solutions. The code is **not** on the `main` branch.

To find the solutions, you must **switch to a different branch**. The problems are grouped into branches, with each branch holding a set of solutions.

### Branch Naming Convention

The branches are named based on the set of questions they contain:

* `Q1-Q10.c` (Contains solutions for questions 1 through 10)
* `Q11-Q20.c` (Contains solutions for questions 11 through 20)
* `Q21-Q30.c` (Contains solutions for questions 21 through 30)
* ...and so on, up to `Q91-Q100.c`.
* will be addind further branches as i progress.

### How to View the Code

1.  At the top-left of the GitHub page, click the button that says `main`. 
2.  A dropdown menu will appear.
3.  Select the branch for the question you want to find (e.g., to find Question 42, select the `Q41-Q50.c` branch).
4.  You can now browse all the C files for that set of questions.
